INSTRUCTIONS 
Here is a list of 1 and 2 grams to describe LLM-powered agents and chatbots that interact with users. All of these terms could show up in various contexts such as articles, products, everyday language, etc. 

```
["artificial intelligence", "large language model", "llm", "chatbot", "a.i.", "ai-powered", "chatgpt", "agent-based", "agentic", "generative ai", "ai assistant", "virtual assistant", "dialogue system", "voice assistant", "bot", "foundation model"]
```

TASK 
Expand this list with 10 additional terms, not already in the list, and return terms as a comma separated list.

CONSTRAINTS 
- Optimize for precision and not recall: Do not include terms that could come up in contexts unrelated to LLM powered agents and chatbots that interact with users.
- Make sure each term is widely used and not esoteric or overly jargony
- Do not include terms that are supersets of existing terms because this will skew word counts. For example, we already have "chatbot" so do not add "user-facing chatbot"

RETURN
A comma-seperated with each term encased in double quotes
